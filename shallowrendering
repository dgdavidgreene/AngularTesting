Shallow rendering eliminates the need for so much boilerplate like for the testbed configuration:

Reuses (and verifies) MyModule contains your component and all its dependencies.

All components inside MyModule are automatically mocked identical inputs/outputs using ng-mocks. 
This is what makes the rendering "shallow".

The tests have far less boilerplate which makes the tests easier to follow.

The mocks are type safe.

Can use HTML to render the test-component IN THE SPEC where it’s easy to find.


Each spec may have different templates, no problem.

We can choose not to use HTML, we just went straight for the bindings. 
The bindings here are type-safe and the output property’s emit function was automatically spied on.
